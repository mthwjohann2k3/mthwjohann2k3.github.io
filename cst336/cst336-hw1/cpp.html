                C++ is a computer programing language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup. It is an extension of the C language.
                It is used for fast speed, low level memory management and is often taught as the first programming language.
                It provides hands-on application of different programming concepts and similar syntax to C and other popular
                languages making it easier to switch.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some advantages of C++ are it provides portability that allows code development without caring about the hardware, it is a mid-level
                programming language, it is object-oriented, it is a multi-paradigm programming language, it supports dynamic memory management, it is
                similar to other languages, it provides a good range of built-in standard libraries, it uses a wide range of applications, it has a vast
                community around it, its program can be scaled to another level, and it has benefits in various departments from finance to app
                developments and GUI to Games.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some disadvantages of C++ are some pointers may be uninitialized (resulting in system failure), it doesn't support garbage collectors,
                it is unsafe in a strong sense, it is not useful for platform-dependent apps and hence is complex in a high-level program, it is very
                strict regarding the syntax (meaning it is less user-friendly and less flexible for the user), it does not provide custom operators
                (existing operators can be redefined by using operator overloading), it does not support built-in threads, it does not support algebraic
                data types, and the functions used are not first-class type.
