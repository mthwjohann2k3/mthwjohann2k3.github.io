                Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language used to build web apps, mobile apps, and enterprise software systems.
                It is known for its Write Once, Run Anywhere capability; any code written in Java can run on any device that supports the Java
                Virtual Machine (JVM). 
            </p>
            <p>
                Java has many advantages including building Android apps, desktop and web apps, enterprise backend systems and cloud-based
                software; having popular frameworks like Spring and Hibernate, making Java powerful for enterprise applications; supporting
                object-oriented programming for clean and reusable code; running on all platforms (Windows, Mac, and Linux) using the JVM.
                Java is also a simple programming language that is easy to learn and understand. It is cheap and economical to maintain, and it is
                platform-independent. It even supports multithreading. It is stable, so it receives regular updates to remove bugs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some disadvantages of Java include slow and poor performance (in this case, it would consume more memory compared to native
                programming languages like C and C++), poor GUI, the lack of backup facility, the requirement of significant memory, and verbose
                and complex syntaxes and code (sometimes remembering complex syntaxes in Java is difficult; many programmers would prefer Python
                or C++ over Java because they have relatively simpler sentences).
