                Programming languages are the formal language, with a set of instructions which provides the desired output. They are used to
                communicate with a computer. Every programming language is based on certain syntactic and semantic rules. There are
                <strong>high-level languages</strong> and <strong>low-level languages</strong>. A high-level language is user-oriented; it has
                been designed to make it straightforward for a programmer to convert an algorithm into program code. Some high-level languages
                that are widely used in education and in the workplace are Python and C#.
                A low-level language is machine-oriented; these programming languages are expressed in terms of the machine operations that must
                be performed to carry out a task. This makes writing programs more difficult as the algorithm needs to be specified in terms of
                capabilities and specifications of the processer. Low-level languages are often called <strong>assembly language</strong> or
                <strong>machine code</strong>.
                Compiled languages are programming languages that require the use of a compiler to compile and execute code; the compilers are
                generally translators that generate machine level code from written source code.

                Some programming languages that are commonly used are C++, Java, Python, and more. They can run on operating systems such as
                Windows, Mac, and even Linux.
                This website will cover some commonly used computer programming languages.
