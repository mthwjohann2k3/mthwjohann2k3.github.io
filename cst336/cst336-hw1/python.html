                Python is a very popular, high-level programming language; it's simple to use, packed with features, and supported by a wide range
                of libraries and frameworks. Its clean syntax makes it beginner-friendly. Python is used in web development, data science, automation, AI,
                and more. It is known for its readability; its code is easier to write, understand, and maintain. It is backed by library support.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most common advantages of Python is that the declaration of variables is not necessary; the data type of the variable is assigned
                automatically during runtime, facilitating dynamic coding. Other advantages are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is an interpreted programming language</li>
                <li>The code gets executed line by line until any errors are encountered, and if any errors occur, the execution stops, and that
                    error is printed on the console, leading to an easier step-by-step debugging process</li>
                <li>More productivity is allowed because Python is an easy programming language; developers can focus more
                    on the algorithms than on coding</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                A common disadvantage of Python is that dynamic typing decreases the speed because it has to do extra work during runtime; thus, it requires
                a large amount of memory. Other disadvantages of Python are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Python typically does not allow multithreading</li>
                <li>Some runtime errors do occur in Python; for example, any undefined variables detected in the code will return a runtime error</li>
            </ul>
